##Overview of project architecture

ModelViewPresenter (MVP) - separate business logic with view logic

Android data binding - automatically bind views, bind model to view

RxJava - manage complex operations through different threads with observable/subscriber pattern 

Dependency Injection (Dagger 2) - control dependencies between modules 

Unit tests with JUnit4 - for decrease amount of bugs after code changes 


Libs : 

Android design library and components 

GooglePlayServices Maps 

Retrofit2 - REST client 

Glide - for SVG image loading (I prefer picasso for image loading with LRUCache inside but it does not support SVG) 


Tools: 

http://www.mocky.io/ - HTTP request mocking 

Stetho - app resources overviw (request debugging, DB review, etc)
